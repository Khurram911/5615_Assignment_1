1.	Write a program to delete the duplicates from an array.
Example: If A = {2,2,5,8,5,9,3} then output should be A = {2,5,8,9,3}
2.	Write a program to find the largest and the second largest number in an array.
3.	Write a program that places all the zeros in an array at the end of the list.
4.	Write a program to find the first non-repeating character in a string.   (Medium)
Example: If the string is "Swiss", then the output should be 'w'. 
5.	Write a program to merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array. 
Example: If A = [1, 3, 5, 7] and B = [2, 4, 6, 8], then the output should be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
6.	Write a program to find the missing number in an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n. 
Example: If A = [3, 0, 1,4], then the output should be 2.
7.	Write a program to check whether a number is Armstrong number or not.
Hint: Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits.
Example: If A= 153, it's an Armstrong number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153.
8.	Write a program to find the longest common prefix in an array of strings.
Example: If the input is ["interstellar", "internet", "intermediate"], the output should be "inter".
9.	Write a program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms (where n is user input).
10.	Write a program that reads N integers, determines how many positive and negative values have been read and computes the total and average of input values.
Sample Output: 
Enter N: 4
Enter 4 values: 1 2 -1 3 
The number of positive numbers: 3
The number of negative numbers: 1
Total is: 5 
Average is: 1.25

Evaluation Criteria:
•	Correctness: Does the program solve the problem as described? Does it handle edge cases properly?
•	Code Quality: Is the code well-structured and readable? Are variables and functions named appropriately?
•	Efficiency: Is the code unnecessarily complex or slow? Are there simpler or faster ways to solve the problem?
•	Comments: Are there comments explaining complex pieces of code? Is the purpose of each function and variable explained?
